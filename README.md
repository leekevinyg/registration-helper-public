# course-registration-helper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/leekevinyg/react-tag-input.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/leekevinyg/course-registration-helper)

A companion helper to a course opening notification service that automates the registration process once a spot has opened up. This repo contains a webdriverio script ```register.js``` that executes an automated course registration workflow. The script can be triggered to execute on Travis CI once a notification of a course opening has been received.
